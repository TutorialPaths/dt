### Privacy
Every human has rights of privacy, the right to be able to keep their own information to themselves and be comfortable in who they trust. For this reason, user privacy is our number one priority.

#### The information we collect
We categorise your personal information into a series of categories.

- Primary data - the data you give us.
- Secondary data - the data we collect.

##### Primary data
Primary data includes information such as email, username, and the **things you tell us** that you are interested in. This data is used throughout TutorialPaths to tune your experience and make it as comfortably personalised as possible.

**By default, all primary data is kept completely private to you.**

**The only parts of your primary data that are public are the following:**

- Your unique user ID.
- Your username.
- Your email.
- Your avatar (image icon).
- The number of credits you have.
- When your account was created.

##### Secondary data
Secondary data is the data that we collect from you when you are using TutorialPaths. This includes information like what tutorials you have viewed recently, the topics **we estimate** that you are interested in, and what devices you use.

**All secondary data collection is toggleable in your user preferences.**

#### How we use your information

- To show more relevant tutorials to you in your feed.
