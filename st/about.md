### TutorialPaths - The unique tutorial platform
TutorialPaths is a tutorial platform designed to make it as easy as possible for you to follow a tutorial as possible. We have solid guidelines and a clear system that make sure all tutorials are high quality and useful.

#### Core features
The main unique feature of TutorialPaths is the 'path system'.

##### The path system
The path system is somewhat inspired by a choose your own adventure book. Some tutorial steps have multiple options at the end, that will direct you along branches to other certain steps.

For example, the step might be to enter a certain command into a command line, and the options could be different results that come up, that may determine what version of a package you are using.

#### Open-source
TutorialPaths is an open-source service. We have [a github](https://github.com/TutorialPaths) where you can poke around our code and see how it all works. Note that all our software is copyright, and be careful not to steal it in any way.
